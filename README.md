## Overview
In 2012, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University launched open online courses on edX, a non-profit learning platform co-founded by the two institutions. Four years later, what have we learned about these online “classrooms” and the global community of learners who take them?

## Problem Setting
Over the years the increasing changes in technology have revolutionized a myriad of daily tasks. Learning or Education is one such task which also faced a revolutionary change with the advent of Educational Technology. Educational Technology is the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate e-learning. One such program is the well-known OpenCourseWare (OCW), launched jointly by MIT and Harvard Universities.

OpenCourseWare (OCW) are course lessons or content curated at universities and published for free on the web. OCW projects first appeared in the late 1990s, and after gaining traction in Europe and then the United States have become a worldwide means of delivering educational content via the Internet.

A similar initiative was launched in 2012 on an online learning platform EdX. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University launched open online courses on edX, a non-profit learning platform co-founded by the two institutions. Through the years gone by, new learners are eager to ask some questions about such online tools before they can delve into it themselves. Through this analysis, we intend to highlight some of the key insights and statistics that could answer most of Frequently Asked Questions.
